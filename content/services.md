## Data analysis and statistics counseling

You may ask some questions and I may answer. If I could do that in a few minutes, I will not charge you. Don't push it though.

If you want to have a more in-depth discussion, which requires a lot of my time, we negociate. I won't charge you if I also do the statistical analysis part (see below).

I could help you with
- study design
- variables selection
- statistical knowledge and second opinions
- tips on publishing or presentation
- interpreting what others published
- tips on software selection
- etc

## Data analysis and statistics

**1. Quick and unpolished**

Within a few hours or even real time, I could have a quick at your data. Don't exppect any formatting of the results. I Will send you the raw output of the softare (maybe with some automatic formating or batch post-processing). You will have to process the results, draw your own conclusions and select what you need.

This is intended for:
- conference abstracts
- preliminary analysis
- those who know statistics, and just want access to my software.

<!-- Typically 50 euro. -->

**2. Just right**

Appropriate for most graduation theses. I expect that you have enough data to fill the necessary number of pages of a typical project. 

I will do some data cleaning, preparation, mathematical transformations, etc. 

I will do the Results section in totality (including basic interpretation of the results), as well as the statistical methods description in the Methods section. I will give you some hints on the other sections. Don't expect me to do the Discussion section. Don't expect me to notice when you have errors in your data or when the results are abnormal. I may know the normal ranges for common stuff such as blood glucose concentation, but probably not for your weird enzyme.

I will format the results according to your institution's templates (hopefully I already have them), and I will send you the output as `.docx` and `.html`.

<!-- Typically 100 euro. -->

**3. Just right, with little data**

Intended for: 
- posters / short presentations
- partial projects (ex. a project that's mostly descriptive, and I only make a multivariate regresion)
- specific analysis (ex. meta-analysis or less common techniques)

I expect that you only have a few variables or can be batch procesed (ex. all are numeric, laboratory values and you want a correlation matrix). I may finish the project in a matter of hours or even in real-time.

<!-- Typically 50 euro. -->

**4. Thorough and polished**

Apropiate for scientific papers. I could spend as much time as necessary on such a project, with multiple meetings and / or feedback sessions. Most likely, extensive data preparation and cleaning steps are needed. I study the data thoroghly, considering multiple alternative hypotheses. I format the charts, tables and text as needed for the paper. Customized templates are a thing.

There is no typical price. We have to negociate. I may start with 100 euro for an easy paper, with good data and clear objectives, but I may ask for additional fees if:
- the data requires extensive preparation steps.
- I have to translate a lot
- there are a lot of variables (even is most are useless)
- you need to process a lot of results
- you cannot [be bothered to] do your own basic formatting
- etc.

## Presentations and posters

If it is just a new output of project that I have already worked on, I will offer a discount. For example, for a typical graduation thesis, I will ask for half the price. If it is a new project, I will usually place it under one of the service above.
