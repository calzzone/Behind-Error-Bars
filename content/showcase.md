While I am waiting for propper permissions form a few persons and publishers, have a look at my most recent paper:

[***A Comparison of Hepatitis E and A in a Teaching Hospital in Northwestern Romania. Acute Hepatitis E - A Mild Disease?***](https://doi.org/10.15386/mpr-1487), published in [Medicine and Pharmacy Reports](https://medpharmareports.com/index.php/mpr/index). Authors:  ***Alexandru Istrate*** and Amanda Lelia RÄƒdulescu affilitated to the Hospital of Infectious Diseases in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

Most of my recent work is avaliable on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/alex_istrate/), but since RPubs does not make a great job of showcasing a prorfolio, I am slowly working on retrofitting a curated portfolio here. I am also working on a portfolio github account, if I could get around some data privacy concerns.
