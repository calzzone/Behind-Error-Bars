# Behind Error Bars

This is my website. I made it for 2 reasons:

1. bragging rights
2. make a business around it (hopefully)

This is my second atempt for a website. The first one was a Wordpress blog and it was slow. Then, I found out about Hugo static websites.

I bought the domain name from [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com). I use [Letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for HTTPS support. I host it on a f1-micro instance on [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com) on Ubuntu 18.04 minimal (LTS). For a few users, it works ok and I'll update it to a better VM if needed. 

I used the tutorials of Chris Titus on [christitus.com](https://www.christitus.com/). I use the same theme ([Mainroad](https://themes.gohugo.io/mainroad/)) as his Hugo site.
